Quite beautiful music, express self vision and hope with cheer up and happy emotions.
The scenes it describes are truly relax, and nature with living atmosphere. 
Also it remains me of The Shawshank Redemption, Andy talked to his friend, a place with freedom.
It has very crazy imagination of the nature or environment around. Feels like illusion. The illusion based on the nature wonders.
