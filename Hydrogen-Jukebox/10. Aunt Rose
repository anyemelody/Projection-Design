It uses the 5/8 rhythm, 1-2, 1-2-3. The integral mood is memory recall with a little sad or sorrow feelings. 
It describes very detail about the Aunt Rose, the limping walking, the facial expression, the dressâ€¦ 
I feel like I can even feel the smell, of the hospital, the death and sadness. 
It make me think of American Horror Story, not the horrible part but the weird and family sweet part. 
Everything is in the memory, it should fade the color, however, the detailed descriptions make me feel its vivid with orange light.
